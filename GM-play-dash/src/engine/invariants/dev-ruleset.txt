Identity is immutable

IDs never change

Time is explicit

No hidden timestamps

Randomness is reproducible

State is serializable

JSON.stringify(state) must always work

Versioning exists from day zero

UI can never “invent” state

Everything must exist in LeagueState
If it changes state, it must be an action.
